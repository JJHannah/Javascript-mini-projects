                Criticism is just someone else’s opinion. It is up to you to
                choose whether to believe some of it, none of it, or all of it.
                What you think is what counts.

                The most essential factor is persistence - the determination
                never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by the
                discouragement that must inevitably come.
