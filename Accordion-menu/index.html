            Criticism is just someone else’s opinion. It is up to you to choose
            whether to believe some of it, none of it, or all of it. What you
            think is what counts.

          <p>
            The most essential factor is persistence - the determination never

            discouragement that must inevitably come.

            Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that
            you plant.
